IS 542 Final Project - Jackson Secrist

For my project, I have created a clone of the popular web-game called Wordle. The goal of the game is to guess the correct 5-letter word in six tries or less. Each time you guess a word, the game will give you feedback on your guess. For each letter of the guess, it will tell you if its either: a correct letter in the correct location (marked green), a correct letter in the wrong location (marked yellow), or an incorrect letter (marked gray). You can use the onscreen keyboard or your own keyboard to enter your guess.

This project is built in React.js. It utilizes components for the guessing board (Board.js), the onscreen keyboard (Keyboard.js), the keys in the keyboard (Key.js), the letters that appear when a guess is attempted (Letter.js), and the game over message (GameOver.js).

Words.js contains helper functions to initialize the word list and the game board on page load. The word list comes from the wordle-bank.txt file included in the project. This is where the target word is selected at random, and each guess is compared to this list to determine if it is a valid guess (words not in the list are not considered words and cannot be used as guesses).
